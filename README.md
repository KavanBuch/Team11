### **Status of "Players" Folder in the Repository**

The player folder contains the profile for each player in the playing 11 which is generated from create_player.c file.It was to be used to calculate the score.Although, it has not been used as it required reading a file inside another file which caused some errors.The final score for each player is generated randomly eventually to calculate the points(see main.c file).
